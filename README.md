# Bessie üêÆ

Bessie is a programming assistant chatbot that can help you with your programming tasks. It uses OpenAI's GPT or Anthropic's Claude models to generate responses based on your request and your codebase.

## Installation

To install Bessie using pip, run the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/aw31/bessie.git
```

### API Keys

Bessie requires either the `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to be set, depending on whose models you want to use. You can set these environment variables in your shell or create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project with the following content:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...      # to use OpenAI models
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...   # to use Anthropic models
```

## Usage

After installing Bessie and setting up the environment variables, you can use the `bessie` command to start a chat:
```bash
bessie "Write a README with instructions to install using pip from https://github.com/aw31/bessie and set up environment variables" bessie/*
```
To end the conversation, send an empty message. The chat transcript will be saved at `bessie.md`.

For more information on how to use Bessie, you can run `bessie --help`:
```
